webpack-components-presenter (alpha)
------------------------------------

CLI utility, that works just like `webpack-dev-server`. But it automatically
finds all the files inside you context folder, containing `__demo__` in their
names and serves list of them, so you can run demonstration of your ui
components.


Just run:

```
components-presenter
```
